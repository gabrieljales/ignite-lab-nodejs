# Ignite Lab 04 - Node.js Edition

## About the project:

- In this edition of Ignite Lab, a notification microservice was created using Node.js.
- The main objective was to encourage the creation of an application thinking first about its business rule, without worrying about external services such as database and ORM from the beginning.
  - In this way, we were able to test our application independently of these services, using concepts such as [in-memory database](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/InMemoryTestDatabase.html). In addition, concepts such as Mappers, Factory Pattern, DTOs and etc.

> I created a note in Notion with some notes that I thought were important, if you want to take a look, just click on this [link](https://ruby-crow-8bf.notion.site/Ignite-Lab-NodeJs-3922efabcaae44b8911f51cbae07e31f).
